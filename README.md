# marketing-portfolio
I'm a third-year Business and Marketing student with experience in customer service and digital content creation. I'm passionate about social media marketing, branding, and consumer behaviour. This portfolio showcases my marketing projects, research, and creative work as I continue developing my skills for future internships and marketing roles.
